Maybe I'm just bein' selfish
Maybe I don't wanna help it
Do that dance for me and let me look at you
Run it back for me, can't never get enough
Maybe I'm just bein' selfish
Baby, I don't wanna help it
Do that dance for me and let me look at you
Run it back for me, can't never get enough (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Ain't no brakes, need a taste whenever I'm next to you (you)
Put your hands on my waist, pull me close, make me feel it all
Throw you back on my bed at (bed)
Wrap my legs 'round your head (head)
We don't gotta play no more
No, it's all for you tonight
Make it rain for you, hope your bed waterproof tonight (yeah)
Hope you can take it all

Maybe I'm just bein' selfish
Maybe I don't wanna help it
Do that dance for me and let me look at you
Run it back for me, can't never get enough
Maybe I'm just bein' selfish
Baby, I don't wanna help it
Do that dance for me and let me look at you
Run it back for me, can't never get enough (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Run it back
Hey, I need you to myself because I'm selfish (so selfish)
I don't need nobody else, I got a fetish (I got a fetish)
I put them diamonds on your finger like we married (hey)
That's why I never fell in love, 'cause that shit scary
And I heard you found another nigga, guess you leveled up (guess you leveled up)
Now she can't get me back, I guess that's what she settled for (she settled for)
Real love is hard to find, next time I wish you better luck (yeah)

Yeah, now I got you drunk as fuck (fuck)
In the back of this truck (skrr)
Talking 'bout how he fucked up, now you wanna be cuffed up with me (oh)
She can't get her hands off (yeah)
Before you leave, just call me Vandross

Maybe I'm just bein' selfish
Maybe I don't wanna help it (I don't wanna help it)
Do that dance for me and let me look at you
Run it back for me, can't never get enough
Maybe I'm just bein' selfish (woo)
Baby, I don't wanna help it (ooh, ooh)
Do that dance for me and let me look at you
Run it back for me, can't never get enough (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Just look at me
Look at me how you be lookin' at your phone
Look at me, how you be lookin' at these hoes
When you scroll and you double-tap, they post
You look at them how you used to look at me when I was all you want
I was back at home when you hit my phone, tellin' me
"When you come to my city, we gon' get it on"
Then I told you, "You should book a flight to try to set the tone"
You flew me out, fed me and fucked me, then you left me alone
You ain't even have to do all that
Could've told me what you wanted, I was cool with that
Instead, you played with my emotions, got a real bitch to open up
And every time you do it, I give you a pass, but uh
I figured out your foolery
You out here livin' off a bitch who ain't got shit on me
One day you gon' find out God ain't made two of me
And that's the day you gon' realize
Ain't no more you and me, fuck nigga
