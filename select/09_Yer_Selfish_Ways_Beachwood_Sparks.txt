You say you like what you're doin'
You say it's the only way to go
Can't you find the love inside
To make this movie roll

You want the world to be better
You want it to be pure
Then why must you lie
There's evil in your eyes
And selfish way's no cure
Who knows the answer?
In each and every way

Come to realize
These times just float right by
Just one more day
Then I have to say
We're all in for the goodbye!
We know the answer
It's plain as day to see
